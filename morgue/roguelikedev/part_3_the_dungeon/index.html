		<h2>Tanked</h2>
		<p>I tanked on complications with the height component of objects amongst other things. This week I've
        brought the whole thing back to basics, re-wrote a whole bunch and have gone back to a single main.js file.
		</p>
        <code>./<a href="src/main.js">main.js</a><br/></code>
		<h2>Open fields instead of dungeons</h2>
		<p>I spent some time looking at dungeons and come to conclusion that an inside/underground feel is not what
        I'm going to be interested in long-term. So instead of dungeons my walls are trees and my rooms are open
        grassy fields.
		</p>
		<h2>Glyph style</h2>
		<p>Something I stumbled upon this week is the large library of Unicode characters I have access to for use
        in my roguelike through a browser. This includes huge sets of a Emoji characters too, which I've taken to
        for use a the player characer ðŸ‘¤ and the trees ðŸŒ³. I've also mixed these in with more traditional ASCII
        characters for the grass <span style="color:green">' "</span>.
		</p>
		<h2>Revised method of 8 way movement</h2>
		<p>After listening to advise last week and also researching how other successful roguelikes do it, I've
        decided to do away with the "wadit for keyup" method I had previously and instead have gone with using a
        modifier (shift+) to change to diagonal direction.
