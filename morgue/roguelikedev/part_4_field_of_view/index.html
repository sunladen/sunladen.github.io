		<h2>FOV and FOW states on tiles</h2>
		<p>Breezed through this part quite quickly. I guess mostly because rot.js has excellent FOV utilities, much like
        the tutorials Python instructions for this part, it's just a matter of keeping track tile participation in the current
        FOV and FOW (fog of war) calculations.

		<h2>Fancy FOV graphic</h2>
		<p>Got a bit fancy with the rendering of tiles that have been seen but are currently out of the field of view. Using
        a transparent checker pattern graphic that gets placed like an overlay over the top.
