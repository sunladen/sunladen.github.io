		<h2>Organising code into modules</h2>
		<p>Time to start moving stuff out of a single file and into modules so I can compartmentalise where things are
			in my head (and on disk). As such the code base has exploded to now look like the following.
		</p>
		<code>./objects/<a href="src/objects/floor.js">floor.js</a><br/>
			./objects/<a href="src/objects/npc.js">npc.js</a><br/>
			./objects/<a href="src/objects/npc.js">object.js</a><br/>
			./objects/<a href="src/objects/pc.js">pc.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/colour.js">colour.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/display.js">display.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/glyph.js">glyph.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/input.js">input.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/main.js">main.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/map.js">map.js</a><br/>
			./<a href="src/polyfills.js">pollyfills.js</a><br/>

		<h2>The Map</h2>
		<p>Close but not identical to the tutorial, I've gone with a single dimension array of Tile objects that
			store their own xy positions and an array of Objects currently occupying the Tile.
		</p>
		<pre>const size = { x: 200, y: 150 }
const centre = { x: Math.floor( size.x * 0.5 ), y: Math.floor( size.y * 0.5 ) }
const tiles = []

function Tile( x, y ) {
	var tile = {
		x: x,
		y: y,
		objects: []
	}
	return tile
}

for ( var y = size.y; y--; ) {
	for ( var x = size.x; x--; ) {
		tiles[ y * size.x + x ] = Tile( x - centre.x, y - centre.y )
	}
}
</pre>
		<h2>A wall is just a floor that is too high to step on</h2>
		<p>Instead of using a "blocked" property on a Tile to define walls and inaccessible areas, I've gone with
			the notion of differences in height between the floor of neighbouring Tiles. Essentially a wall
			is just a floor that is too high to step on from your current elevation. All Objects in the
			world will in-fact have a z property, and a Floor is just an Object like everything else.
		</p>
		<h2>Expansion of the player intention system</h2>
		<p>Continuing with the directional triangles to indicate walking direction from Part 1, now that the map
			has an NPC and walls I've added the following hints.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Impassable height (i.e walls) uses a traditional "#" as the hint</li>
			<li>Interaction with NPCs uses "!" as the hint</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Walking on the NPCs head is a <del><span style="color: red">bug</span></del><span style="color: green">feature</span></h2>
		<p>When I showed a first draft of my Part 2 solution to people in the Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/9pmFGKx">channel</a>,
		we had a laugh when someone noticed that if you approach the NPC from the elevated floor behind the NPC, the height check
		doesn't deem the difference great enough to block so movement gets allowed and you end up standing on top
		of the NPC. Luckly from the NPCs head you are allowed to moved either back up or continue down to the lower elevation.
		</p>
		<p>I decided to leave this in as a feature and just cleaned it up a bit so while the NPCs height from the lower floor
			gets deemed passable when travelling in a downwards direction, I didn't want to be able to jump back up on to the head of
			a short NPC from an equal or lower elevation than the NPC itself.
		</p>
