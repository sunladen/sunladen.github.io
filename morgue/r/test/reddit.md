Working towards a first release of my hobby game. Last week I was happy enough with my [water](https://old.reddit.com/r/hobbygamedev/comments/bdcub2/playing_around_with_textures_simplex_noise_time/) effect. This week its the centre of the players world, a camp [fire](https://between2spaces.github.io/r/test/fire/).

Images used with this effect include [campfire](https://between2spaces.github.io/r/1/assets/campfire.png), [flame](https://between2spaces.github.io/r/1/assets/flame.png), [ember](https://between2spaces.github.io/r/1/assets/ember.png), [smoke](https://between2spaces.github.io/r/1/assets/smoke.png).

Straight up randomness is used to determine when an ember or puff of smoke is created. Noise is used to determine lateral offsets and elapsed time determines opacity and vertical offset.
